## Description
This app generates a software engineering team using command line application. 

## Installation 
Use "node app.js" in your terminal to start the application.

## Usage Information
Run the app by using the command line "node app.js" in your terminal/gitbash. Then, you will be prompted with a series of questions about your employee. Answer the questions. Then, the app will ask you if you wish to add more employees, and if so, will run throught the prompts again. 

Enter all of your employee data and when you're finished, you'll have a working html fall called "team.html" in the output folder. Open this to see a display of your team.
